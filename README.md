# Bingo Caller v2

This was a project that I decided to make after an activity where I helped run a bingo game. One person called out the numbers, and I wrote the numbers called on a word document that was projected for the players to see what numbers were called. As I ran the word document, I realized that there was a better way that it could work, and run by one person.

The program is simple. An array from 1â€“75 is created. Then the array is shuffled. When the call button is clicked, the first number in the array is taken out of the array, and sent to find the associated letter. When the letter is found, it will print it on the screen, and the most recent letter and number combination is in a large font, indicating that it was the most recent. When all the numbers are printed out, it automatically sorts it by the number in ascending order.
